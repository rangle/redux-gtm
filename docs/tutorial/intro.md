Getting Started with ReduxGTM
=============================
Google Tag Manager (GTM) makes it quick and easy for digital marketers to manage what events are sent to analytics servers such as Google Analytics (GA). However, integrating GTM and developing a maintainable tagging strategy is challenging for those who are new to it. Here I am introducing an open source project called [ReduxGTM](https://github.com/rangle/redux-gtm) that resolves the challenge with GTM integration for apps using [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) or [ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store).

The aim of this tutorial is to walk you through the basic setup of the library in a sample application. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to track GA [pageviews](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6086080?hl=en) and GA custom events on any Angular2 application that uses Redux.
